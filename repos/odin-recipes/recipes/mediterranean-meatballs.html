    <h1>Mediterranean Meatballs</h1>
    <img src="/recipes/Mediterranean Meatballs.jpg" alt="Meatballs image">
    <p>There are 22 countries that border the Mediterranean, and one of them is Greece.
         These meatballs are ground beef-based, and they are chock-full of fresh herbs,
         garlic, and other seasonings that may remind you of Greece.
         Use these meatballs as appetizers,
         or serve them inside pita bread with lettuce and tomato.
         In either case, be sure to serve with plenty of tzatziki,
         either one you purchase,
         or one you make from scratch from a recipe on this site.</p>
